## About

This is the first in a sequence of 4 courses on "computational economics and finance". The aim
of this sequence is to give students the tools needed to use a mixture of economics+finance and
programming to understand the world around them.

In this module we will begin to introduce the basics of the tooling that will be used throughout
the sequence. This will include both mathematical topics (such as linear algebra and probability)
and programming topics (such as Python and pandas). We will assume little prior programming
knowledge. We do take for granted that you know linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and
probability and statistics, but, when possible, we will refresh your memory on relevant topics.

The course was designed and will be taught by

* Chase Coleman (cc7768@gmail.com)
* Spencer Lyon (spencer.lyon@hey.com)
* Thomas Sargent (ts43@nyu.edu)


## Delivery

Instructor lead classes will occur twice a week

* **Tuesday**: 08:30-10:20
* **Friday**: 08:30-10:20


## Grading

Your grade for module 1 will consist of 4 components:

* Homework (25%)
* Exam (45%)
* Quizzes (30%)

We encourage you to study in a group and to work collaboratively on homeworks (but everyone must
submit their own assignment), however, the exam and quizzes should both be done individually.
